# Chapter I. THE ALTERNATIVES MODEL

Dreams Don't Come True

## The Rustle of the Morning Stars

I was woken by the neighbour's dog barking. The nasty animal was always waking me up. How I hated it! Why should I have to be woken up by the noise of someone else's pet? I decided to go out for a walk, calm down and distract myself from the intense desire to set fire to my neighbour's house. They say dogs are like their owners. This one was. There always seemed to be some idiot in my life trying to get me down. Feeling stressed I started to get dressed. My slippers had disappeared again. Where are you, you sneaky little buggers? When I find you I will chuck you out!
我被邻居家狗的狂吠吵醒了。那只讨厌的畜生总是把我吵醒。我多么恨它！凭什么我要被别人宠物的噪音吵醒？我决定出去走走，冷静一下，让自己不要那么强烈地想去放火烧掉邻居的房子。人们常说狗像它的主人，这只就是。我的生活里似乎总有某个蠢货想让我心情低落。感到压抑的我开始穿衣服。我的拖鞋又不见了。你们这些狡猾的小家伙在哪儿？等我找到你们，就把你们扔掉！

It was foggy and damp outside. I walked along the slippery path through the gloomy forest. Almost all the leaves had fallen, exposing the grey trunks of half-dead trees. Why do I live in the middle of this depressing bog? I reached for a cigarette. I didn't really want one, but old habits told me I needed one. Need? At what point had I become addicted to cigarettes? It's not very pleasant smoking in the morning on an empty stomach. I used to be a social smoker. It had been fashionable, a symbol of freedom and style. But the party ends and the grey, drizzle of everyday life sets in, bringing with it problems in patches like slimy puddles. You smoke each problem away several times as if saying to yourself: "I'll just have this quick smoke, catch my breath and then launch myself back into the dreaded routine."
外面雾气沉沉、湿漉漉的。我沿着湿滑的小路穿过阴郁的森林行走。几乎所有的叶子都已飘落，露出半死不活的树木灰色的树干。为什么我会住在这片令人沮丧的沼泽里？我伸手去拿一支烟。我并不是真的想抽，但旧习惯告诉我需要一根。需要？我什么时候开始对香烟上瘾了？空着肚子在早晨抽烟可真不舒服。我以前只是社交场合才抽的烟。那时它很时髦，是自由与格调的象征。但聚会总会结束，生活的灰色细雨便开始淅淅沥沥地落下，带来一滩滩黏滑的麻烦。你一根又一根地抽掉这些问题，就像在对自己说：“我先抽根烟缓口气，然后再重新投入那令人厌恶的日常。”

The smoke got in my eyes making them sting, so I placed my hands over them for a minute like an upset child. I was so fed up of everything. As if reading my thoughts, a birch branch bent spitefully and hit me hard on the forehead. Bastard! In my outrage I broke the branch in half and threw it to one side. The branch got caught in a tree and bounced from side to side and sprang up and down like a jack in a box as if mocking my inability to change any aspect of my world. Feeling very low I pushed on.
烟雾熏进了我的眼睛，刺得我直难受，于是我像个委屈的小孩一样用双手捂住了眼睛。我对一切都感到厌倦。仿佛是读懂了我的心思，一根桦树枝恶意地弯下，狠狠地打在我额头上。混蛋！我气得把它折成两截，扔到一边。那根树枝被挂在另一棵树上，左右晃动、上下弹跳，像个玩偶盒里的小丑，似乎在嘲笑我无法改变世界的任何一部分。情绪低落的我继续往前走。

Every time I tried to battle with the world it would at first yield, giving me false hope, only then to come back at me with a hard slap. It's only in films that the hero sets off towards his goal casting aside anything and everything that stands in the way. In reality, things are a bit different. Life is like a game of roulette. You win once, twice, even three times. You imagine yourself the prize-winner with the world at your feet but always end up with less than you started. You are just the turkey fattened up to be roasted and devoured to the sounds of happy music and laughter. You were fooling yourself. It's not your lucky day. You made a mistake…
每次我试图与这个世界抗争，它起初都会退让，给我虚假的希望，接着再狠狠地回敬我一巴掌。只有在电影里，英雄才会朝着目标出发，把一切挡路的东西都抛到身后。现实可不一样。生活就像一场轮盘赌。你赢过一次，两次，甚至三次，你以为自己是赢家，世界就在你脚下，但最终总是比一开始还要失去更多。你不过是一只被养肥的火鸡，等着在欢快的音乐与笑声中被烤熟、被吞食。你只是自欺欺人。今天不是你的幸运日。你搞错了……

Wallowing in dark thoughts I arrived at the beach. Sharp waves were biting viciously at the sandy shore. The cold, damp sea breeze blew at me bitterly. Fat sea gulls wandered the shoreline, lazily pecking at rotten waste. Their eyes carried a cold, black empty look as if reflecting the cold and antagonism of the world around me.
沉溺在阴暗的思绪中，我走到了海滩。锋利的浪花恶狠狠地啃咬着沙岸。冰冷潮湿的海风凛冽地扑面而来。肥胖的海鸥在岸边游荡，懒洋洋地啄着腐烂的垃圾。它们的眼睛里透着冰冷、漆黑、空洞的神情，仿佛映照着周围世界的寒冷与敌意。

A tramp was collecting empty bottles on the beach. I wished he would disappear. I wanted to be alone but he was walking towards me, probably wanting to scrounge something. I decided to go home. Was there no peace anywhere? I was so tired. I realised that the feeling of tiredness never left me, even when I was relaxing. At some point I had started killing time as if sitting out a prison sentence. I was always waiting for things to change, for a new stage in my life to begin where I would be different and able to enjoy life, but that stage was always somewhere in the future. In the meantime it was the same old drudgery. I kept waiting but the better future remained as elusive as ever. I would return home and do the same thing I always did; eat a boring breakfast and then leave for my dull job, forcing myself to produce results which mattered to someone else but not to me. It would be just another day of the same tiresome, meaningless life.
一个流浪汉在海滩上收集空瓶。我真希望他能消失。我只想一个人呆着，可他正朝我走来，可能想要讨点什么。我决定回家。难道哪儿都没有安宁吗？我太累了。我意识到，即便是在休息的时候，这种疲惫感也从未离开过我。不知从什么时候起，我开始消磨时间，就像在服一场无期徒刑。我总是在等着事情发生变化，等着人生进入一个新的阶段，在那个阶段我会变得不一样，可以享受生活。但那个阶段总是停留在未来。与此同时，现实依旧是同样的繁琐劳碌。我一直在等待，可更好的未来始终遥不可及。我会回到家，做着老一套：吃一顿无聊的早餐，然后去干那份枯燥的工作，强迫自己产出一些对别人有意义、对我却毫无意义的成果。这又将是同样乏味、毫无意义的一天。

I was woken by the rustle of the morning stars. What a sad dream. It was as if I had returned to a period in my past. Thank goodness it was only a dream. I stretched with relief just like my cat does. There he was lying lazily sprawled out–only his ears giving any sign that he was aware of my presence. Get up you whiskered thing. Are you coming with me for a walk? I had placed an order for a sunny day and so set off towards the sea.
我被晨星的窸窣声惊醒。多么悲伤的一个梦啊。那仿佛让我回到了过去的某个时期。谢天谢地，这只是个梦。我像我的猫一样舒了一口气，伸了个懒腰。它正懒洋洋地摊在那儿，只有耳朵动了动，表明它知道我的存在。起来啊，你这长胡须的家伙。要不要跟我一起去散步？我已经向今天预定了一场阳光灿烂的好天气，于是便向着大海出发了。

The path led through the forest and the rustle of the morning stars gradually faded, giving way to the multi-voiced choir of the bird nation. Someone in the bushes was trying especially hard "Food! Food!" There he was the little wretch. However can such a little ball of fluff squawk so loudly? Only now did it occur to me that although every bird had a different voice, none were ever out of tune with the rest of the choir. They always managed to produce such a graceful symphony; no orchestra, however sophisticated could be favourably compared.
小径蜿蜒穿过森林，晨星的沙沙声渐渐消退，取而代之的是鸟儿王国多声部的合唱。灌木丛里，有个家伙格外卖力地在叫着：“吃的！吃的！” 原来是那只小家伙。真难以想象，这么一小团毛茸茸的东西居然能发出那么大的噪音。直到这时我才意识到，虽然每只鸟的声音都不一样，但它们的歌声从来不会与合唱跑调。它们总能奏出那样优雅的交响曲——再复杂精妙的管弦乐队也无法与之相比。

The sun stretched its rays between the trees, creating a magical backlighting that highlighted the voluminous depth and richness of the colours of the forest and transforming it into one miraculous hologram. The path led me diligently towards the sea. The emerald waves exchanged whisperings with the warm sea breeze. The shore seemed endless and empty but I felt comfortable and at peace as if the overpopulated world had created a secluded corner just for me. Some people believe the world is an illusion created by the mind but I could not imagine having such a high opinion of myself that I could think all this beauty was the product of my own consciousness.
阳光从树间伸展出光线，制造出一种奇妙的逆光效果，把森林的色彩深度与丰盈感衬托得淋漓尽致，将其变成一个神奇的全息奇景。小径耐心地引领我走向大海。碧绿的波浪与温暖的海风低声私语。海岸仿佛无边无际、空无一人，而我却感到舒适与平和，仿佛这过度拥挤的世界特意为我留了这样一个幽静的角落。有人认为，世界是心灵创造的幻象，但我无法想象自己竟会有如此高的评价，认为这所有的美丽都源自我的意识。

Still feeling the effect of my oppressive dream I began to reminisce about my former life, which had actually been as dull and gloomy as my dream. Like a lot of people, I had often demanded that the world give me all I felt it owed me but in response it had turned its back on me in indifference. I was advised by others wiser and more experienced than myself not to give up because the world doesn't give up that easily either. "You have to fight for what you want". So I tried battling with the world but I didn't get anywhere and ended up exhausted. My advisers had a ready answer for this too. "You are the problem. Change yourself before you start demanding things of life". So, I battled with myself but this turned out to be even harder than battling with the world.
仍然带着压抑梦境的余味，我开始回想起自己的过往生活，那实际上同我的梦境一样沉闷而阴郁。和许多人一样，我常常要求世界给予我觉得它欠我的一切，但回应我的只是它冷漠地转过身去。那些比我聪明、阅历更丰富的人劝我不要放弃，因为世界也不会轻易放弃。“你必须为自己想要的东西而战。”于是我试着与世界对抗，可我哪里都去不了，只是弄得精疲力竭。我的劝告者对此也早有答案：“问题在你自己。在要求生活给你什么之前，先改变自己。”于是我开始与自己作战，可这比与世界作战更难。

Then one day, I dreamed that I was in a nature reserve. In the dream I was surrounded by indescribable beauty. I was walking through the reserve and admiring the full wonder of it all when I came across an angry old man with a grey beard who, as far as I could make out, was the Guardian of the Reserve. He watched me in silence. I walked up to him but as soon as I opened my mouth to speak he cut across me. In a cold tone he said that he didn't want to hear a word; he was tired of noisy and capricious visitors who were constantly displeased, always making demands and left mountains of rubbish after themselves. I nodded in sympathy and walked on.
直到有一天，我梦见自己身处一座自然保护区。梦中，我被难以形容的美景所包围。我走在保护区中，沉醉地欣赏着这一切奇观，这时遇见了一位留着灰色胡须的愤怒老者，我猜他是这片保护区的守护者。他默默地看着我。我走向他，但刚一开口，他就打断了我。冷冷地说，他不想听我说任何一句话；他厌倦了那些喧闹又任性的访客，他们总是抱怨不停、提各种要求，还总是留下成堆的垃圾。我同情地点点头，继续走了下去。

I was amazed by the unique beauty of the reserve and wondered why I hadn't visited it before. Enchanted, I continued to wander around taking in the magnificence on all sides. No words could fully describe the perfection of the landscape. My mind went blank in stunned admiration.
我为保护区独特的美景而惊叹，不明白自己为什么以前从未造访过这里。被深深吸引着，我继续四处漫步，尽情感受四周的壮丽。任何语言都无法完全描绘这种景色的完美，我的思绪在惊叹中一片空白。

Soon the Guardian appeared before me again. The austere look on his face had softened and he beckoned for me to follow. We climbed to the top of a green hill and from there the spectacular view of a picturesque valley opened before us. I could make out some kind of village with toy houses decorated with plants and flowers like an illustration in a book of fairy-tales. Had the scene before me appeared more real I could have stood regarding it with delight for some time. As it was, I started to suspect that such fabulous beauty was the stuff of dreams and not real life. I turned to the Guardian with a questioning look but he just sneered into his beard as if to say: "We're only just getting started!"
不久，守护者再次出现在我面前。他脸上的严肃神情有所缓和，并示意让我跟上。我们爬上一座翠绿的山丘，从那里俯瞰到一片如画的山谷。隐约可见山谷中有个小村庄，玩具般的房屋装饰着植物与花朵，就像童话书里的插图。如果眼前的景象再真实一些，我大概会久久站在那里欣赏。但就在此时，我开始怀疑，这般奇幻的美丽恐怕只存在于梦境而非现实。我转向守护者，带着疑问的眼神看他，可他只是抿着胡子冷笑，似乎在说：“我们才刚刚开始呢！”

As we descended into the valley below it began to dawn on me that I could not remember how I had arrived at the reserve. I was hoping the old man could give me an explanation. Then I must have made some clumsy remark about how it must feel pretty damn good to be one of the lucky ones who could afford to live in such a beautiful place, to which, openly displaying his irritation, the Guardian replied: "Who is stopping you from joining them?"
我们下到山谷时，我突然意识到，自己根本不记得是怎么来到这个保护区的。我希望老者能给我一个解释。于是我或许笨拙地说了句：能住在这样美丽的地方一定感觉棒极了吧，真是幸运的人。听到这话，守护者明显露出不耐烦的神色，说道：“那是谁阻止你加入他们了？”

I started to go on about how not everyone was born rich and we don't choose our fate. The Guardian ignored my words and said: "That's the point. Everyone is free to choose any destiny they wish. The only freedom we truly have is the freedom of choice. You can choose anything you want."
我开始辩解说，不是每个人都含着金汤匙出生，我们也不能选择自己的命运。守护者无视我的话，只说：“正是如此。每个人都可以自由选择自己想要的任何命运。我们唯一真正的自由，就是选择的自由。你可以选择你想要的一切。”

His statement did not at all fit with my philosophy of life and I made to argue with him, but the Guardian would not listen: "Fool!" he said. "You have the right to choose, but you don't exercise it. You do not even understand what 'to choose' really means." This is ridiculous, I thought. What does he mean by, "I can choose whatever I want"? Anyone would think that you could just conjure up anything you wanted. At that moment I suddenly realised that I was dreaming. The situation threw me and I did not know how to behave.
他的说法与我的人生观完全不符，我想与他争辩，可守护者根本不听：“傻瓜！”他说，“你有选择的权利，但你并没有去行使它。你甚至不懂什么叫‘选择’。”这太荒谬了，我心想。他说的“我可以选择我想要的一切”是什么意思？难道你以为随便一想就能变出你想要的东西？就在那一刻，我突然意识到自己在做梦。这种情况让我有些慌，不知该如何应对。

As far as I can recollect I hinted to the old man that he could chose to speak rubbish whether in a dream or in waking but there ended the extent of his freedom. My comment did not seem to bother the Guardian at all; in fact he laughed in response. Aware of how ridiculous the situation was (what was the point of getting into a debate with a figure from my own dream?) I was considering whether it would be better to wake myself up. As if reading my mind the old man said: "That's enough. We don't have much time. I hadn't expected them to send me a moron like you, but I must carry on with my mission nonetheless."
我依稀记得，我暗示老者，他可以选择胡言乱语——不管是在梦中还是醒着的时候——这就是他自由的全部范围。我的评论似乎一点都没有惹恼守护者，反而让他笑了起来。意识到这种情形有多么可笑（跟自己梦里的角色辩论还有什么意义？），我开始考虑是不是该把自己弄醒。似乎看穿了我的心思，老者说：“够了，我们没有多少时间。我没想到他们会派一个像你这样的笨蛋来，但我还是得继续执行我的使命。”

I was going to ask him what his 'mission' was, and who 'they' were but he ignored me, instead giving me a riddle, which at the time seemed quite absurd: "Everyone can have the freedom to choose whatever they want; but here's a riddle for you: how do you acquire that freedom? When you guess the answer correctly your apples will fall to the sky."
我正打算问他所谓的“使命”是什么，“他们”又是谁，可他没理我，而是给了我一个当时看来十分荒谬的谜语：“任何人都可以自由选择自己想要的一切；但这里有一个谜语：你如何才能获得这种自由？当你猜对答案时，你的苹果会落向天空。”

What apples? I was beginning to loose patience and said that I had no intention of solving any riddles. Miracles only happened in dreams and fairy-tales. In reality, apples generally fall to the ground, to which he replied: "That's enough! Let's go. There is something I must show you."
什么苹果？我开始失去耐心，说我根本没打算解什么谜。奇迹只会发生在梦境和童话里。在现实中，苹果一般是掉到地上的。对此他只说：“够了！走吧，我有东西要给你看。”

Regrettably, when I woke up I could not remember the end of the dream. However, I did have the distinct feeling that although I was unable to express it consciously, the Guardian had imparted some kind of information to me. Just one word seeped through into my mind but I had no idea what it meant: Transurfing. The thought I found going round my mind was that I did not have to totally furnish my world myself; that everything that was to be mine had been created long ago without my participation but for my own well-being. There was absolutely no point in battling with the world for a place under the sun, and no-one was stopping me from simply choosing the life I wanted to have.
遗憾的是，当我醒来时，已经记不起梦的结尾。然而我清楚地感到，尽管无法用意识表达，但守护者确实向我传递了某种信息。只有一个词渗入我的脑海，但我不知道它是什么意思：Transurfing（现实跃迁）。我脑中盘旋的想法是：我并不需要完全靠自己去建构我的世界；属于我的一切早已在很久以前被创造出来，不需要我参与，而且是为我的幸福而存在的。与世界争夺阳光下的位置毫无意义，没有人阻止我去直接选择我想要的生活。

At first the idea seemed absurd. I would probably have forgotten all about it if I had not to my amazement soon afterwards started having very clear recollections of what the Guardian meant by the word 'choose', and how to actually make a choice. The answer to the Guardian's riddle came to me of its own accord; as knowledge does sometimes seem to come from nowhere. Every day I learned something new and each time I felt huge surprise, sometimes bordering on fear. I can give no rational explanation of how this knowledge came to me but of one thing I am certain. I could never have made it up myself.
起初，这个想法显得很荒唐。如果不是让我惊讶的是，没多久之后，我居然开始非常清晰地回忆起守护者所说的“选择”是什么意思，以及如何真正做出选择，我大概早已将它忘记。守护者的谜底自然而然地浮现在我脑海中，就像知识有时会不知从何处涌现。每天我都学到新的东西，每一次都感到巨大惊讶，有时甚至接近恐惧。我无法给这种知识的来历一个理性的解释，但有一点我很确定：我绝不可能凭空编造出它。

Ever since I discovered Transurfing (or rather, since I was given it to discover) my life has been filled with joyful meaning. Anyone who has ever been involved in some kind of creative work will know the happiness and fulfilment that comes with creating something with your own hands. Imagine then the feeling of creating your own destiny. Even the expression 'to create your own destiny' as it is interpreted in its usual sense, fails to describe what I mean here. Transurfing is a method that frees you to choose your own destiny, literally like you would choose something in a supermarket. I want to share this with you so that you can understand why 'apples fall to the sky', why the 'morning stars rustle', and many other curious things.
自从我发现了现实跃迁（或者说，自从它让我去发现它）以来，我的生活便充满了喜悦与意义。凡是做过创造性工作的人，都会明白用双手创造出某件东西时的幸福与满足。那你想象一下，创造自己的命运该是怎样的感觉吧。即便是通常意义上“创造自己的命运”这句话，也不足以表达我在这里的意思。现实跃迁是一种方法，让你可以真正自由地选择自己的命运，就像在超市挑选商品一样。我想把这件事分享给你，让你明白为什么“苹果会落向天空”，为什么“晨星会沙沙作响”，以及许多其他奇妙的事情。

## The Guardian's Riddle

There are different interpretations of the nature of fate. One interpretation is that fate is your lot in life, something predetermined and which however hard you try, you can never escape. This definition is rather limiting as it suggests that if a rough lot has befallen you in life there is no hope of anything ever getting any better. Despite this, there will always be those who willingly accept this definition of fate because it is convenient. They would rather life be reliable and the future more or less predictable than live with the fear of uncertainty.
对命运的本质有着不同的解读。
一种解释认为，命运是你生命中的定数，是早已被预先决定好的，无论你多么努力，都无法逃脱。
这种定义颇为局限，因为它意味着，如果你在人生中遭遇了不幸的际遇，那么无论如何都不可能变得更好。
尽管如此，仍然会有人愿意接受这种命运观，因为它很方便。
他们宁愿生活稳定可预测，也不愿面对未知的不确定性。

Nonetheless, the total inevitability implied by this interpretation of fate leaves one feeling dissatisfied and even a little resentful. People who are deprived of good luck lament their fate and naturally question why life is so unfair. Why is it that some people have more than they could ever desire, while others never seem to have enough? Why is it that things come easily to some, while others never achieve results however hard they try? Some people are endowed with natural beauty, intellect and strength, while others seem to have an inferior goods label stuck to their forehead for their entire life as if paying for some kind of previously committed sin. Why does such inequality exist? Why does life in its endless diversity place limits on certain groups of people and where exactly did those less lucky go wrong?
然而，这种完全不可避免的命运观，往往让人感到不满足，甚至有些怨恨。
那些缺乏好运的人会抱怨自己的命运，并自然地质疑，为什么生活如此不公平。
为什么有些人拥有超过他们所能渴望的一切，而另一些人却始终无法得到满足？
为什么有些人轻而易举就能成功，而另一些人无论多么努力也毫无收获？
有些人生来就拥有美貌、智慧与力量，而另一些人似乎一辈子额头上都贴着“次品”的标签，仿佛在偿还某种前世的罪孽。
这种不平等为何存在？
生活在无限多样性中，为什么要对某些人设置限制？而那些不幸的人到底错在哪里？

People often feel hurt and indignant when they realize they are less fortunate than others and they search for an explanation for their circumstances. This is when many people turn to teachings that support ideas such as karma and retribution for sins committed in previous lives. One would think that all the Lord our God had to do with his time was discipline his naughty children and that despite his omnipotence he evidently struggles with the parenting side of things, putting off the punishment of retribution until a later date. One wonders what the point could be of punishing a person for something they do not actually remember doing.
人们在意识到自己不如别人幸运时，常常会感到受伤与愤懑，并去寻找一种解释自己的处境的理由。
于是，许多人转向那些支持“业力”以及“前世罪孽惩罚”的教义。
仿佛上帝除了管教不听话的孩子之外，就没有其他事情可做；而且，尽管他全能无所不能，却在“做父亲”这件事上显得力不从心，不得不把惩罚推迟到未来的某一天。
然而，惩罚一个人做过的事，却让当事人自己完全不记得，这又有何意义？

Another popular explanation for inequality spreads the false hope that those who suffer and live their lives in need will later receive generous compensation, although it is not clear whether good fortune awaits them in heaven or in a future life. Whatever the arrangement, explanations like these can never leave one fully satisfied. Whether past and future lives exist or not is also of little significance. You can only be aware of the life you are living now and so in this sense, it is the only one you have.
另一种流行的解释则是给人一种虚幻的希望——那些此生受苦、缺乏所需的人，将来会得到慷慨的补偿，
只是并不清楚这份好运会在天堂等待他们，还是在未来的某一世出现。
无论如何，这样的解释都无法令人完全满意。
至于过去和未来的生命是否存在，也并不重要。
因为你只能意识到自己正在过的这一生，所以从这个意义上来说，这就是你唯一的生命。

If you believe that your fate is predetermined then the best remedy for the despondence you may feel is acceptance. There will always be people around to give you good advice like, "If you want to be happy just be happy! Be optimistic; be satisfied with what you have." There will always be someone to tell you that the cause of your unhappiness is your own constant complaining and unrealistic expectations of life and that you could be happy by definition if you would simply reconnect with your inner joie de vivre. You might half-heartedly agree whilst at the same time awkwardly acknowledging how uninspired you really feel about greeting your dull life with new-found joy. Surely we have the right to expect more. Why should we have to force ourselves to be happy when it is as futile as trying to force yourself to love someone?
如果你相信命运是预先决定好的，那么缓解你可能产生的沮丧情绪的最好办法就是接受它。
总会有人给你这样的“好建议”：
“如果你想要快乐，那就快乐吧！要乐观；要满足于你已经拥有的一切。”
也总有人会告诉你，你的不快乐是因为你总是抱怨、对生活有着不切实际的期望；
如果你愿意重新连接内心的那份生活热情，你就能“按定义”地感到幸福。
你或许会半心半意地点头同意，但同时尴尬地承认，面对自己单调乏味的生活，你其实提不起迎接它的兴致。
我们难道没有权利期待更多吗？
为什么我们要强迫自己快乐，就像强迫自己去爱一个人一样徒劳？

Then there are the "enlightened" individuals preaching universal love and forgiveness. Their world is like a blanket of illusion that you can pull up over your head to protect yourself from encountering the severity of life head on, and everything does get a little easier as a result. Deep down however, it is still difficult to comprehend why you should forgive those you hate and love those you have no genuine feeling for. What good is happiness if it is faked? Surely happiness should come naturally rather than being squeezed from the soul like the last drop of toothpaste from a tube.
还有那些宣扬“普世之爱”与“无条件宽恕”的“开悟者”。
他们的世界就像一条幻象的毯子，可以把它拉过头顶，隔绝现实生活的残酷，结果生活的确因此变得轻松了一些。
然而，在内心深处，你仍然很难真正理解，为什么你应该去原谅那些你恨的人，并去爱那些你并无真情的人。
如果快乐是伪造的，那又有何意义？
真正的快乐应当是自然而然流淌出来的，而不是像挤牙膏最后一滴那样从灵魂中硬挤出来。

There are others who refuse to believe that life is boring and primitive enough to be reduced to predetermined fate. This type of person would rather be satisfied with what they have managed to achieve by their own abilities than accept the lot they have been dealt. This is a different perception of fate whereby you make your own luck and good luck has to be fought for. That is just how it is. Wise people will tell you that life is not given to anyone on a plate and that if you are not satisfied with what you have, you must dig your heels in and work hard to attain the happiness you want.
还有一些人拒绝相信生活会无聊且简单到仅仅被还原为一种预先决定的命运。
这种人宁愿为自己凭能力取得的成就而感到满足，也不愿接受上天给他们的“分配”。
这是一种不同的命运观：你创造自己的好运，而好运需要去争取。
事实就是如此。
智者会告诉你，生活不会白白送给任何人，如果你对已有的不满足，就必须咬紧牙关努力工作，才能获得你想要的幸福。

The history books describe brave heroes who fought and laboured day and night, overcoming unimaginable obstacles. The victors were rewarded with the laurels of success but only after suffering all the burdens and privations of battle. This take on fate is not very logical either. Millions of people battle and labour but true success comes to but a few. You can spend your entire life struggling desperately for a place under the sun and yet get nowhere. Why would life be so cruel and unyielding?
历史书中记载着那些英勇无畏的英雄，他们日夜奋斗，克服了难以想象的障碍。
胜利者最终收获了成功的桂冠，但那是在承受了战斗中的一切重负与艰辛之后。
然而，这种命运观也并不合逻辑。
数以百万计的人在奋力拼搏，但真正成功的却寥寥无几。
你可以穷尽一生拼命争取在阳光下占据一席之地，却依然一无所获。
生活为何如此冷酷无情？

What a heavy burden it is to have to battle with the world to get what you want and if the world does not respond, to have to battle with yourself. How hard it is to believe that if you are poor, ill, ugly or unlucky it is your own fault; that you are flawed and so must change. These ideas suggest that you are an accumulation of various shortcomings and defects which must be worked on. Unless you are lucky enough to be born rich and happy, your lot in life is either to humbly bear your own cross or dedicate your entire life to fighting against it. It is somehow not a view of life that readily fills the heart with joy. Surely, there is a glimmer of hope among these dismal beliefs.
要与世界抗争以获得你想要的东西是一种沉重的负担；
而如果世界不回应你，你还得与自己作战。
很难相信，如果你贫穷、疾病缠身、相貌平庸或运气不佳，那全是你自己的错；
你是有缺陷的，因此必须改变。
这些观念暗示，你是由一系列缺点和不足构成的集合体，必须被修正。
除非你足够幸运，生来富足又快乐，否则你的一生要么是谦卑地背负自己的十字架，要么就是倾尽一生与之抗争。
显然，这样的生活观并不足以让人心生喜悦。
然而，在这些阴郁的信念中，的确存在一丝希望的曙光。

Fortunately, there is a glimmer of hope that comes from a totally different view of things. The solution is as simple as it is enjoyable in contrast to the other views described above. In Transurfing the concept of fate is based on an alternative model of the universe. Before you wave your hand in disappointment and decide that you are being fed yet another chimera, remember, that every known concept of fate originates from a specific worldview, which in turn, is based on a number of unproven principles.
幸运的是，这一丝曙光来自一种完全不同的观点。
相比上面所描述的各种观点，这个解决方案既简单又令人愉快。
在“现实转化术”（Transurfing）中，命运的概念基于另一种宇宙模型。
在你挥手失望、认为这不过是又一个幻想之前，请记住，每一种已知的命运观，都源自特定的世界观，而这种世界观本身，又是建立在一些未经证实的假设之上的。

For example, materialism is founded on the proposition that matter is primary and consciousness is secondary. Idealism claims the opposite. Neither of these philosophies has been proven, and yet models of the universe are constructed around both. Each model is convincing enough and has its loyal defenders. Both materialism and idealism explain the phenomenon of the world via philosophy, science and religion, and both are right and both are wrong in their own ways. Man will never be able to describe absolute truth with total accuracy because the notions used in our attempts to describe the truth are of themselves relative. There is a well known parable about three blind men who describe an elephant by studying it with their hands. The first blind man touches the elephant's trunk; the second touches the leg, and the third touches ear. Each draws conclusions about what kind of animal the elephant represents based on their own findings. It would be pointless to try and prove that only one description of the three is correct. What is important is that the description be relevant and applicable.

这两种哲学都没有被证明，却各自构建了自己的宇宙模型。
它们都足够有说服力，并且都有忠实的拥护者。
唯物主义和唯心主义都通过哲学、科学和宗教来解释世界现象，并且在某种程度上两者都对，两者也都错。
人类永远无法用绝对精准的方式描述“绝对真理”，因为我们用来描述真理的那些概念本身就是相对的。

试图去证明三人之中只有一个是正确的，是毫无意义的。
重要的并不是谁说的对，而是这种描述是否具有相关性和适用性。

You have no doubt heard the idea expressed that reality is an illusion created by the mind, but no one has explained in detail where the illusion comes from.

Does it mean that we are all in a sense watching a film? Of course, it is highly unlikely that a concrete, rational substantiation of this idea will ever be upheld. Others hold the opposite opinion that the material world is simply a mechanism which functions according to its own immutable laws and cannot be governed by human consciousness. There is surely an irrefutable grain of truth in this idea.

The human mind likes to have its feet on solid ground free of ambiguity and so for centuries scholars have been tearing one theory to pieces in favour of another which is then placed high on a pedestal. After every fight on the intellectual battlefield for truth just one fact remains undefeated: every theory represents a separate aspect of the phenomenon of a multi-faceted reality.

Each theory that stands the test of time has its place for they all represent one aspect of reality. If you decide that fate is something predestined that you cannot personally change, then this is how it will be. In effect you are voluntarily giving yourself to the will of others, becoming like a small boat floating at the mercy of the waves. If however, you decide that you can create your own destiny then you will consciously take responsibility for everything that happens in your life, battling against the waves in an attempt to sail your little boat. You may have noticed that whatever you choose is always manifested. What you choose is what you get. Whatever worldview you choose to believe in, the truth of that worldview will always be on your side and others will argue with you because they too are right.

Any aspect of reality can be taken as a starting point and subsequently developed into a whole field of knowledge and it will have logical consistency and successfully reflect one manifestation of reality. An entire field of knowledge can be substantiated by just one fact which although not fully understood, has its place.

For example, quantum physics is based on a number of unproven truths and postulates which cannot be proven because they serve as the basic starting point for a given field of knowledge. In quantum physics a microcosm sometimes acts as a particle and sometimes as a wave. Unable to provide an unambiguous explanation for such dualism, scientists took the phenomenon to be an axiom. The postulates of quantum physics bring together different aspects of reality in all its diversity of form, just like the blind men in the parable in one case proclaimed that the elephant functions like a stump and in another, like a snake.

If in describing the microcosm one chooses to start with its particle quality as fundamental then one arrives at the model of the atom created by the famous physicist Neils Bohr. In the Bohr Model the electrons rotate around the nucleus like the planets in the solar system. If on the other hand, one takes the main quality to be the wave then the model of the atom will look like a blurry dot. Both models work reflecting different manifestations of reality. In this case too, one could say that the scientists get what they choose.

Any manifestation of reality can serve as a postulate, or the basis for an argument which will undoubtedly make sense and have its place. In search of truth people have always striven to understand the nature of the world, studying its individual parts. Bodies of scientific knowledge were created to describe and explain the various phenomenon of nature and often they contradict each other.

The nature of the world is one but it reveals itself to us in many guises. As soon as one face has been studied and explained another appears that does not fully correspond to the first. Scientists have attempted to overcome these contradictions by encompassing the diverse manifestations of reality in a single model of the universe, but this is no easy task. There is one irrefutable fact that unites and reconciles all branches of knowledge and that is the diverse and multifaceted nature of reality. Variability is the world's most fundamental quality.

For some reason, the defenders of different fields of knowledge disregard this fact in their attempts to describe individual phenomenon, despite the fact that there is so much that could be learned from it. Variability is a key reference point, just like zero is the main reference point on a coordinate grid. Any starting point for a particular area of knowledge is secondary in relation to this key reference point of variability and yet it is bypassed as if it held no information. Nonetheless, it does carry information and information of quite an extraordinary nature.

To solve the Guardian's riddle we will take the quality of variability as a starting point. In other words, we will take as a postulate the fact that reality manifests itself in an infinite variety of forms. Despite the very general nature of this postulate it reveals quite fascinating knowledge.

We start with the idea that all diverse manifestations of reality originate in a common source. The world manifests itself as movement of matter through time and space and this movement is subject to certain laws. As you know, points are plotted on a graph in accordance with mathematical formula. You could say that the function which determines how points are plotted on a graph is also a law. So where are the laws of the universe 'written'? Formulae like laws are but an abstract product of the human mind created for the convenience of expressing concepts. It is highly unlikely that the laws of nature are recorded anywhere.

Could a graph be created that marked the position of all points of matter? Of course, one could theoretically mark the coordinates of the infinite number of all existing points in the universe but the capacity of the human memory is too limited to cope with such a massive volume of data. Nature on the other hand has no difficulty with eternity. Nature has no need of a formula to generalize the position and movement of points on a graph. If the graph line were to be broken up into infinitely small points then every point could be seen as a cause and the next point as the consequent effect, whereby any movement of a point of matter through time and space could be perceived as an infinite chain of infinitesimal examples of cause and effect.

In science, we describe the movement of matter in terms of laws but in nature this movement exists in its natural form as the infinite flow of cause and effect. Generally speaking, information concerning all possible points along the path of moving matter is stored in an information field which we refer to here as the alternatives space. The field contains information about everything that ever has been, is, and ever will be.

The alternatives space is a material information structure. It is an infinite field containing information on all possible scenarios of any event that could ever possibly take place. One could say that the alternatives space contains absolutely everything. We can hardly guess the form this information takes and yet our purpose here does not require us to know this. The important thing is to establish that the alternatives space serves as a template or coordinate grid for the movement of all matter in time and space.

Every point in space contains its own version of a given event. For the ease of understanding let us say that each variation or version has a script and scenery. The scenery is the external form of a phenomenon, whereas the script is the path that matter moves along. For the sake of convenience the alternatives space can be said to have different sectors. The greater the distance between the sectors, the more the script and scenery will differ. A person's destiny also has numerous alternatives.

Theoretically speaking, there are no limits to the scripts and sceneries of human existence because the alternatives space is infinite. Any seemingly insignificant event can affect a twist of fate. A person's life, just like any other movement of matter represents a chain of cause and effect events. In the alternatives space the effect is always located in close proximity to its cause. One follows the other and so the sectors of a person's destiny create a life line. The scripts and settings of the sectors on one line are more or less uniform. A person's life flows evenly in one direction, until such time as an event occurs that changes the scripts and sceneries. When this happens destiny takes a turn and shifts to another life line.

Experiencing life lines placed very close together is like watching a play and then the next day going to the theatre again to see the same play but this time the stage scenery is different. If during the next theatre season you saw the play with the same actors but there had been significant changes to the script this would be like experiencing a life line situated slightly further away in the alternatives space. Finally, if you watched the same production in a different theatre you would see a totally different interpretation of the play and this would be like experiencing a life line that exists a significant distance from the first.

Reality has such diversity of form because the number of alternatives for its manifestation is limitless. Any starting point for one or another form of manifestation results in a chain of cause and effect relationships. One could say that reality unfolds through life depending on the selection of the original reference point and so ultimately, everyone gets what they choose. You have the right to choose precisely because an eternal number of alternatives already exist. No-one is preventing you from choosing the destiny you would feel comfortable having. Managing your own destiny comes down to one single thing – making the choice. Transurfing shows you how to make that choice.

So, an information structure exists that contains an infinite number of potential alternatives each with its own unique script and scenery. The process of transformation into physical reality corresponds to that laid down in the information structure. How matter moves through the alternatives space can be demonstrated by the following metaphor.

Imagine a water pipe with a cooling ring that moves slowly along the pipe causing the water inside it to freeze. The effect of the cooling ring makes it look as if a crystal of ice is moving through the water. Water molecules tend to remain in roughly the same place in a relatively free state. At the moment that the cooling ring passes through a given section of water the molecules inside the ring are solidified into a frozen crystal. As the ring moves further down the pipe, the frozen water in the area behind the ring melts again and the molecules are freed up. It is not the crystal itself that moves. In other words, it is not a single chunk of ice that floats through the water, but the potential to create the structure of ice, i.e. the frozen state.

The water in the pipe serves as an analogy for the alternatives space and the crystal of ice as an analogy for the material manifestation of a particular alternative. The water molecules are like people and their position in the crystal structure is like a manifestation in physical reality of one possible fate. There is no single answer to the question of what the cooling ring symbolises. In other words, how and why the information structure transforms into physical matter, no-one can say. In a microcosm, matter can behave as a bundle of energy. We know that in a vacuum for example, micro particles undergo a continual process of birth and annihilation suggesting that matter is present and yet does not represent a physical substance. The one thing that is clear is that the things we can touch have an intangible energetic foundation to them.

I hope I have not overwhelmed the reader with too much physics, particularly as we are just at the very beginning of Transurfing. The things you learn in this book may come as a bit of a surprise, so naturally, I offer some theoretical substantiation just to help the mind keep a firm footing. Do be patient.

The wave is another analogy for the process of physical manifestation in which the sea is the alternatives space and the wave the material manifestation of a given alternative. Take a wave that forms in the sea after an earthquake. It looks like the wave moves across the surface of the sea in a hump, but in fact, the water remains in the same place. It is not a mass of water that is moving across the sea so much as the energetic potential for transformation into physical reality. It is only when the accumulation of water finally reaches the shore that it breaks on the ground. Any other wave behaves in the same manner.

Does this mean that material manifestation moves through time and space while the potential alternatives remain in one place for eternity in the space of everything that was, is, and will be? Why not? Time of itself is as static as space. The passing of time is only felt when it turns like film footage, one shot following another. If you unroll the film and look at all the frames put together, there is no time because all the frames exist simultaneously. Time is static until we start looking at each frame in sequence. It is the same in life, which is why the idea that everything comes and goes is so deeply rooted in our minds.

Everything that is recorded in the field of information has always been there and will always be there. Life lines exist like a reel of film. Things that have happened in the past do not just disappear and what has yet to be in the future is already present here in the now. The current section of a person's life is a material manifestation of the alternatives space in this section of their life line.

This idea might be slightly perturbing and you may be asking yourself how it is possible for countless alternatives of your own fate to exist simultaneously in stasis. Who is responsible for this, God or the laws of Nature perhaps? Imagine a point on a coordinate grid. In school we are taught that any point on the grid can have any x and y coordinate from minus to plus infinity and yet it does not occur to anyone to ask why a point can have absolutely any coordinate. Imagine if the point that moves along the function line were surprised and asked: "How can this be that the path I have travelled so far has always existed and always will and how can it be that the path I am about to travel has already been outlined in advance?" It would seem strange to the point but not to you because you are observing its path from above able to see things from a different perspective.

The alternatives space serves as a template that determines how physical reality can show itself. Imagine a person walking through a dark forest with a torch. In the dark the person holding the torch lights up a small area around themselves. The entire forest is like the alternatives space while the area which is lit up is like the physical manifestation of the alternative in that area. The question remains as to what provides the light; in other words, what 'ignites', i.e. materializes a particular alternative within the template.

To answer this question we need to take a different starting point. Nowadays most people agree that thoughts are material. There is also evidence that reality takes two forms: on the one hand material existence defines consciousness and on the other hand there is clear evidence to the contrary indicating that consciousness also defines physical existence. Therefore, thoughts not only provide the motivation for human action, they also have a direct influence on our reality. For example, our worst expectations generally tend to come true. Of course one could argue that this is not because our thoughts were materialized but rather that our thoughts were a premonition of impending misfortune that would have occurred anyway. There is undoubtedly much that is unclear and ambiguous about paranormal phenomena. However, that does not mean that one should ignore or negate the relationship between thought and the process of material realization. Much evidence exists to indicate the direct impact of thought on reality.

One way or another, individual consciousness shapes a person's destiny. This book focuses specifically on how this is possible. Thought energy transforms possible alternatives into physical reality. This statement is correct because reality can be manifested in any form defined by consciousness. Evidence of this hypothesis can be found not only in everyday life but also in the experiments of quantum physics. For our purposes, the specific mechanism by which thought energy interacts with the alternatives space is of no great consequence. It is not yet clear by what means the transfer of information takes place, whether on an energetic level or by some other means. For convenience sake we will simply work with the idea that thought energy 'lights up' a certain sector of the alternatives space, as a result of which, one alternative is transformed into physical reality. Waves of thought energy find the sector in the alternatives space that corresponds in quality. The alternative of that sector is then made manifest on the physical level, marking the process of how consciousness creates reality.

You should bear in mind that this is only one way of manifesting reality. Generally speaking it is not possible to create the reality you desire simply by sitting in one place and contemplating it. Although people do exist who are capable of materializing objects literally out of air, they are very few in number and as a rule do not advertise their abilities. Nonetheless, thoughts have as much impact on a person's destiny as concrete actions do. People are used to the idea that there is a visible and clearly comprehensible connection between their actions and the consequences of them. By contrast, the impact of one's thoughts manifests imperceptibly and so appears inexplicable and unpredictable. It might seem difficult to determine a causal relationship between one's thoughts and subsequent events, but soon you will see that the connection is quite direct. A person gets what they choose.

Some may conclude that I seem to be saying that the seas, mountains, planets and the galaxy are all just a product of their personal thought energy. This is because people have a tendency to consider themselves the centre of the universe, whereas in actual fact they are just a tiny dot in infinite space. The world is inhabited by millions of living organisms and every single one of them contributes to the creation of reality. Every living being has its own characteristic thought energy. If you are not comfortable viewing plants as capable of 'thought', then you can refer to the process differently; it does not change the nature of the phenomenon. Nobody can say with certainty that inert objects do not have a quality similar to the thought energy emanated by living beings, to say nothing of the One Spirit, permeating all things, which we call God. Every being has consciousness and forms the layer which makes up its own world. One could say that everything in this world carries a particle of God and this is how he governs the whole world.

We all live in the same world and yet every individual moves along their own life line. The qualities of the material world are the same for everybody; it is just that its concrete realization is unique within the context of a person's life. For example, imagine that you are a tourist walking around a beautiful city. You admire the sites and the architecture. You take in the flower beds, the fountains, the park avenues and the smiling faces of the city's prosperous inhabitants. Then as you pass by a rubbish bin you see a homeless person. He is in the same city as you, and the same dimension but he does not see what you see. He sees an empty bottle in the bin, a dirty wall, his competitor who wanted the bottle too and a policeman eyeing him with suspicion. You live on one life line and the homeless man on another. Your life lines intersected at a point in the alternatives space, bringing you together into the same world in the dimension of physical reality.

All manifestation of a material nature has an energetic foundation. The energy field is primary and all physical manifestation is secondary. Scientists attempt to unite different manifestations of energy within the context of a single theory and soon they will achieve good results. However, they will find that they have to keep adding many more things to the theory because reality takes an infinite number of forms. Without going into too much detail we will take energy to be an abstract force which is invisible but nonetheless exists. For our purposes it is enough to accept the fact that the energy of human thought is material. Thought energy does not just spin round inside a person's head; it flows out into the space beyond the head and interacts with the wider energy field around us. Few would dispute this fact now.

For convenience sake we can talk about the parameter of thought energy that is frequency, just as radio waves have a frequency. Whenever you think about something in particular the frequency of your thoughts becomes attuned to a certain area within the alternatives space. When the thought energy reaches the relevant sector in the alternatives space the potential reality held within that sector begins to materialize. Energy has a highly complex structure and permeates everything that exists in the world. When energy passes through the human body it is modified by that person's thoughts. By the time it exits the body it has acquired the same parameters as the thoughts. A radio transmitter works in the same way. Energy absorbs the characteristics of the thoughts of one's mind. When energy exits the human body it radiates outwards in a thought wave that in turn transforms the sector of the alternatives space into physical reality. Whenever you think about something be it negative or positive you are radiating thought energy in the alternatives space. Modified energy accumulates in a specific sector of the field and this has the effect of introducing corresponding changes into your life.

The circumstances of a person's life are not only created by their actions but also by the nature of their thoughts. If a person has a hostile attitude towards the world, they will find the world responds to them with the same. If a person constantly expresses dissatisfaction, they will find more and more reasons to be dissatisfied. If a person's attitude to life is predominantly negative, the world will show them the worst side of its nature. Conversely, having a positive attitude is the most natural way to change your life for the better. People get what they choose. Like it or not, that is how life works.

Whilst your thoughts are pretty much homogeneous you will stay on the same life line. As soon as your relationship to reality changes in any way the parameters of thought energy take on new characteristics and the material manifestation of the layer of your world shifts to another line. On this new line events unfold according to a different script in accordance with the parameters of thought. If for some reason you dislike the new script you will struggle to change the situation. People tend to react negatively when they come up against obstacles, expressing their dissatisfaction or falling into despair. As a result, the thought energy they radiate refocuses to a line on which the number of obstacles is even greater making it seem as if their life is a slippery slope.

It might seem as if this process cannot be controlled but in fact the individual is in control and it is their own thoughts that are directing the path of material realization into problematic areas of the alternatives space. People think that obstacles can be overcome by action but in actual fact they ultimately experience whatever their dominant thoughts are. So if you choose to battle against the obstacles on your path you will experience an abundance of obstacles. If you are absorbed by thoughts about your own problems you will find that there are always problems in your life. Even if you take action to change the situation on your current life line on the material level it will not change the original script in the alternatives space. All you can effectively do is choose a different script. By trying to change parts of the script you do not like you inevitably get caught up thinking about what you do not like. Your thoughts are then successfully realised and you end up getting what you do not want.

You cannot change anything about the current life line just as in an art gallery you cannot take away or reconstruct exhibitions that are not to your taste as you are not the owner. However, no-one is to stop you from turning round and walking into the next room to look at something you can appreciate more. Of course, the shift to a life line in which everyone gets what they want on demand does not happen simply by wishing for it. Not all thoughts can be realized and not all desires are fulfilled. The reason for this is not the content of a person's thoughts so much as their quality. A dream or a wish does not qualify as a choice. Dreams do not come true. To create the reality you want you have to observe certain conditions which you will read about later in this book.

The alternatives space contains an infinite number of possible life lines for every individual. No-one should feel hard done by if they do not like their fate, because everyone has the right to choose. The problem is that we do not know how to choose. The world has such diversity of form one would think it was created to satisfy any need. Everyone can find whatever their heart desires. Even in the academic world life manifests the side of it we wish to see. For example, idealism holds that the world is an illusion, and life agrees. Materialism says the opposite, and again the world has nothing against that. People argue with each other, trying to force others to accept their relationship to the world, and yet the world shows that they are all right. Is that not wonderful? The alternatives space is the so-called illusion and material realization is what is meant by physical reality. We always get what we choose.

Those who are familiar with the principles of Islam will understand what is meant by "a person's fate is written in the Book". This means that fate is preordained and therefore cannot be changed or avoided. Similar statements can be found in other religions. In a sense, a person's destiny is indeed already preordained. The error of religion is in teaching that there is just one version of a person's fate when in fact there are endless alternatives. They say you cannot avoid your own fate and to some extent this is true because it is impossible to change the script within any given alternative of it. To battle with the world around you in the hope of changing your fate is a difficult and thankless task. It is not worth trying to change the script. It is far more effective to choose a different alternative more to your liking.

Of course, this is all quite strange and you may quite reasonably have your doubts. I do not expect anyone to accept the alternatives model just like that. I did not believe in it myself until I became convinced that it actually works and flawlessly at that. It makes no sense to give preference to one model of the universe over another just for the sake of some absolute truth. It is not the model itself that has meaning so much as what it can help you achieve. Different mathematical models can illustrate the same physical phenomenon in different ways. It would be hilarious if specialists in analytical geometry suddenly took up arms against mathematical analysis and tried to prove that geometry is the only true mathematical discipline. Mathematicians have been able to agree among themselves, but philosophers and religious leaders have not.

It is difficult to say where the alternatives space actually is. From the point of view of our three-dimensional reality one could say that it is everywhere and nowhere. Imagine an endless surface without beginning and without end inhabited by two-dimensional people. These people would not suspect that a third dimension exists. They would believe that the surface they live on is the only world that exists and could not imagine that anything else existed beyond it. We know though, that a third dimension should be added to this model, and that an infinite number of similar surfaces could be created. So there is no need to be concerned if you cannot visualize an infinite number of parallel worlds aside from our own. It is just a matter of perspective.

It is hard to believe in the existence of parallel worlds. Having said that, how easy is it to believe in the theory of relativity, which claims that an accelerating body increases its mass, reduces its size and slows down the time through which it moves? It is impossible to test the theory firsthand but that does not matter. It does not matter whether we understand a theory. What matters is the practical benefit that can be derived from it.

In the context of infinite space it is ridiculous and even petty to argue about the advantages of one model over another. Try to imagine the infinite in terms of increasing distance that never reaches a horizon. Oddly enough, infinity in terms of decreasing distance has no limit either. We can observe only a limited portion of the visible universe for telescopes and microscopes have their limits too. Nonetheless, infinity in the context of the microcosm is no different from infinity in terms of the macrocosm.

There is a theory that the visible universe emerged as a result of the 'Big Bang'. According to the theory the universe has been constantly expanding ever since. Celestial bodies move through the cosmos with phenomenal speed but when we take into account the huge distances involved it seems as if the expansion of the universe is taking place incredibly slowly.

It is also a well established fact that in a vacuum, at any given moment in time elementary particles are born out of nowhere and then immediately disappear. We do not yet know the exact structure of elementary particles but given the relativity of time and space there is nothing to stop us perceiving each particle as if it were a separate universe like our own. Physicists claim that they can appear either in the form of waves or in the form of particles. The further one goes into the microcosm the more relative distances appear huge, and for the internal observer time slows down. To an external observer our universe might appear to last for just one brief moment like a particle birthed and extinguished in a vacuum, whereas we, its internal observers, perceive the universe to have been in existence for billions of years.

The next time you take a mouthful of coffee ask yourself how many universes you have just swallowed. Infinity cannot be divided into parts and so if you think about it, every time you swallow a mouthful of coffee you are swallowing an infinite number of universes. Flying through a microcosm takes as long and seems as far as it does flying through the boundless expanse of outer space. Time like space goes on for infinity whether you look backwards or forwards. Intervals of time can be as infinitely large as they can be infinitely small. Any point within a time interval can be seen as a reference point–both sides of which extend into the infinity of time. Changing the reference point to another place within the time interval does not change the extent of infinity in either direction.

The infinity of worlds within worlds exists simultaneously. The centre of the universe is at the same time to be found in every point of matter because every point is surrounded by infinity on all sides. All events exist concurrently for the same reason that the centre of the universe is located in every point at the same time. This is difficult to imagine but so is it impossible to grasp infinity in one moment of contemplation. Even more convoluted theories have been designed which claim that the visible universe becomes a finite sphere in fourth-dimensional space, but that does not help particularly, because theoretically speaking, an infinite number of dimensions could exist. Unable to clearly imagine all of this, we have to content ourselves with a narrower perspective and at least pretend that we understand something of these theories.

There are many things about contemporary science that are impossible to explain or comprehend; however, this should not prevent us from benefiting from the fruits of scientific thinking. Applying the principles of Transurfing can lead to stunning results. The important thing is to decide from the very beginning not to torture yourself with questions of why and how exactly it all works which would be as productive as a child asking a physicist why different bodies attract. The scientist would reply: "Because of the law of gravity." The child then follows with the next question: "How does the law of gravity work? Why do bodies attract?" There is no answer to this question, so we will leave the thankless task of trying to explain these things, for it is not ours to know and understand everything. We will simply enjoy the results of the alternatives model.

From the alternatives model it follows that man can create his own destiny. In Transurfing the concept of fate differs from other more widely accepted interpretations. The difference is that in the context of Transurfing a person can choose their happiness; they do not have to fight for it. There is no need to accept or reject the alternatives model straight away. First ask yourself this question: Have you achieved much by battling with the world to find happiness? Each person will decide for themselves whether they wish to carry on in the same vein or whether they would prefer to try using a different method. A person can spend their entire life battling without achieving anything at all. Would it not be simpler to act in a way that encouraged life to meet you half way, for all life does is help manifest your personal choice.

Whatever you 'order', your choice is always granted unconditionally. Choice however, is different to desire. Wishes are only granted in fairy tales and most people just keep on wishing. It is no wonder that the belief is so ingrained in our minds that wishes are very difficult, if not impossible to fulfil. We have already taken the first small step towards solving the Guardian's riddle. Soon you will find out why wishes are not granted and dreams do not come true.
